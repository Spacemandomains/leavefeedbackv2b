# leavefeedbackv2b
The purpose of this app is to allow Airbnb guest to create a video bounty for the Airbnb they are interested in booking. They want more feedback in the form of video. 

We created this webapp using Chat GPT, Google forms, Stripe, Dorpbox and Vimeo. 

First Airbnb guest create a post using the form.

Second the post is added to the leave feedback page. 

Third Pirates who may have videos from a past stay or are currently staying or even the host themselves can collect the video bounty by submitting the video of the Airbnb properties for pay.

Fourth Pirates are paid by paypal using their email upon sumbitting their video of the property once verified. 

Fifth videos of Airbnb properties are collected and stored for future request.
